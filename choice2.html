    <h1>The Haunted<br>Mansion</h1> 
    <p>You shake your head and turn away from the mansion, quickening your pace as you walk back along the overgrown path. However, with every step, you feel as though someone—or something—is watching you from the shadows. Suddenly, you stumble and fall, unable to move. The darkness consumes you.</p>



<h3>You become one of the mansion's lost souls, forever haunting its grounds.<h3>
