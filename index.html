    <h1>The Haunted<br>Mansion</h1> 
    <p>In the shadow of moonlit trees, a decrepit mansion looms, its windows like hollow eyes peering into the night. Ivy clings to its crumbling walls, whispering secrets of forgotten souls. Dare you step beyond the threshold into the darkness? The haunted mansion awaits, hungry for curious souls to wander its halls.</p>

      <h3>Salisbury Cathedral</h3><br>
      <img src="images/salis.jpg"></a>
      <p>The United Kingdom’s Salisbury Cathedral, consecrated in 1258, is an Anglican cathedral built in the Early English Gothic style. The Cathedral Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as it is also known, includes a heavily buttressed church spire – the tallest in the UK - that contains no bell. The cathedral is home to the oldest working clock in the world (built in 1386 or possibly earlier) and one of the original surviving copies of the Magna Carta.</p><br>
