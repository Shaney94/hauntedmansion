    <h1>The Haunted<br>Mansion</h1> 
    <p>You smash the mirror with all your strength, the sound of shattering glass echoing through the room. As the shards fall to the ground, the room is consumed by darkness. When the light returns, you find yourself standing in the mansion's entrance hall, safe but forever haunted by the memories of what you saw.</p>



    <h3>You escape the mansion, but its horrors will haunt you forever.</h3>
