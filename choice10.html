    <h1>The Haunted<br>Mansion</h1> 
    <p>You turn and run, your heart pounding in your chest as you race through the empty halls. Behind you, the whispers grow louder, urging you to stay. But you refuse to listen, driven by fear and desperation. Finally, you burst through the mansion's front doors, collapsing on the cold ground outside.</p>



    <h3>You escape the mansion's grasp, but the memory of its horrors will haunt you forever.</h3>
